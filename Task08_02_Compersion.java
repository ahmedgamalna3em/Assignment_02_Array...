    compare between binary search and linear search in terms of performance
    and best case and worst case and average case.
    =========================================================================
    1-Binary Search :-
    * array must sorted before use binary search.
    * we know value started and end
    * make middle(started+end)/2
    * make loop and make compersion if(value == arr[middle]) return index
    * else if value< arr[middle] the location for end change = middle - 1
    * else if value > arr[middle] the location for start change = middle + 1
    * Time Complexity => o(log n) ===> iam don't know why

    2-Liner Search :-
    * array not needed sorted.
    * we take value and compersion any index in array.
    * Time Complexity => o(n)
